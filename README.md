# Deep Learning Course by CognitiveAI(IBM)

It is a deep learning course where I completed two courses:
 - Deep Learning Fundamentals
 - Deep Learning with Tensorflow

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks for Labs where I practiced the number of Neural Network models using Tensorflow API.

In these courses I have studied about:
- **AutoEncoders**
- **Restricted Boltzman Machines**
- **Deep Belief Networks**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks**
- **Recurrent Neural Networks**
- **Long Short-term Recurrent Neural Networks**

These courses incldues Labs for hands on practice for implementing following using Tensorflow:
- Linear Regression Model
- Logistic Regression Model
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Restricted Boltzman Machine

In these labs, I have understand the detailed implementation of each concept in detail which helped me learning Tensorflow from basic to Advanced.

It also includes Grade questions to test your knowledge for whatsoever I have studied in video tutorials and labs.

Once I completed the couse, The IBM congnitive class offers a **Certificate** once I completed their **Final Exam** which contains multiple choice question. The level of the exam is Intermediate. I have completed two exams and received the certificates for them which is present in the repository.

Here, I learned Tensorflow basics and this will help me in **Keras** based projects.
